# CNN Image Classification

This project aims to create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model capable of training on the CIFAR-10 dataset and classifying images based on the ten different classes available.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the implementation of a CNN model for image classification using the popular CIFAR-10 dataset. By training the model on this dataset, we aim to achieve accurate and reliable classification results across a variety of images.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies were utilized in this project:

- Python: Programming language used for implementing the CNN model and associated scripts.
- TensorFlow: Deep learning framework used for building and training the CNN model.
- Keras: High-level neural networks API used as a frontend for TensorFlow, simplifying the model creation process.
- NumPy: Library used for efficient numerical computations and array operations.
- Matplotlib: Visualization library used for plotting and displaying images and performance metrics.
- Git: Version control system used for tracking changes and collaborating on the project.
- GitHub: Hosting platform for the project repository and collaboration with others.

## Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset can be downloaded from the following source:

- [CIFAR-10 Dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

Please download the dataset and ensure it is available in the appropriate directory before running the model.
